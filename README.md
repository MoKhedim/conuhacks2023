##Inspiration
We were inspired by the growing need for online security in today's digital age. With more and more personal information being shared online, we realized the importance of strong, secure passwords.

##What it does
Our website offers a password strength checker, which analyzes your current password and gives you a visual representation of its security level. The web application also includes a customizable password generator that helps you create strong and unique passwords that meet your specific needs. Further, we provide educational resources and data to assist users in understanding the importance of robust password security.

##How we built it
Our team made the UI/UX of the website using React.js and Bulma. The password strength checker employs a variety of regular expressions and algorithms to analyze the security of a password. Furthermore, the password generator utilizes an algorithm to create unique and secure passwords based on user-specified criteria.

##Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was finding a way to accurately and efficiently analyze the safeness of a password. We also had to create a fully functional password generator that meets the user's criteria and is secured.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of being able to create a user-friendly website that makes it easy for anyone to check and improve their password security. We're also proud of the password generator, which offers a wide range of options and creates truly unique and secure passwords.

##What we learned
We learned a lot about the importance of password security as we researched statistics on the subject and the different methods used to analyze and improve it. We also learned the importance of ensuring the website is user-friendly and easy to use.

##What's next for Can't crack that
In the future, our team plan to add more advanced features, such as two-factor authentication and integration with other security tools. We also intend to continue enhancing the user experience and add more educational resources to help users understand the importance of good password security.
